# Introduction

Paw is the open-source GitHub repository for Paw, the discord bot powering [The Paw Kingdom](https://discord.gg/tpk)!

Paw was built on code from a former project known as [exorium](https://github.com/MiataBoy/exorium) by current developers MiataBoy and ToothyDev.

# Functionalities
Paw can provide a variety of things to your server! For example:

üòò interaction commands!

üêï Sona generator!

# Self-hosting

Paw is not able to be selfhosted easily because it's tightly integrated into the server it was made for.
You are however free to fork this repo and remove any server-specific code you find, after which it should work as
expected.
Here's a step-by-step guide to launching the bot once you've done that:

1. Create a bot account on https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Invite the bot with oauth scopes `bot` and `application.commands` to a guild of choice
3. Clone your repository onto a server (If you don't have one, you may find VPS's for cheap at https://ovh.com) with
   `git clone https://github.com/MiataBoy/Paw.git`
4. Make sure Python 3.12+ is installed
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Use PM2 or a similar tool to run the bot (`pm2 start bot.py --name Paw --interpreter python3`)
